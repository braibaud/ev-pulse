# Introduction to the EV Database Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Electric Vehicle (EV) Database! This database is designed to manage comprehensive information about electric vehicles, including their variants, motors, batteries, and associated attributes and features. The documentation will guide you through the schema, functionality, and usage of the database.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this database is to provide a structured and efficient way to store and retrieve information related to electric vehicles. It supports the definition of various entities (such as brands, models, variants, batteries, and motors) and their hierarchical relationships. The database also allows for the inheritance of attributes and features, making it easier to manage and update information across related entities.

## Key Features

- **Entity Management**: Define and manage different types of entities, such as brands, models, variants, batteries, and motors.
- **Attribute and Feature Inheritance**: Attributes and features can be inherited from parent entities, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency.
- **Vehicle Configuration**: Store and manage configurations of electric vehicles, including their variants, motors, and batteries.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the database to include new types of entities, attributes, and features.

## Getting Started

To get started with the EV Database, you can explore the following sections:

- **Schema Overview**: Understand the structure of the database and the relationships between tables.
- **Entity Management**: Learn how to define and manage entities, attributes, and features.
